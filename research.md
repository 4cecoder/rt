# Research on Warp Terminal

## Story

Warp Terminal was founded by Zach Lloyd and a team of developers in 2021, initially as a startup focused on reinventing the terminal emulator for modern developers. The original vision was to create a more usable and powerful terminal, addressing pain points like poor UX, lack of features, and inefficiency in traditional terminals (e.g., iTerm, Terminal.app). Over time, with the rise of AI, Warp evolved into the "Agentic Development Environment" (ADE) in 2025, integrating AI agents to automate coding, debugging, and deployment workflows. The mission is to empower developers to ship better software faster by combining human creativity with AI superpowers, positioning developers as "tech leads" for AI agents rather than manual coders.

Warp is backed by top-tier investors including Sequoia Capital, Google Ventures (GV), Neo, Box Group, and notable individuals like Dylan Field (Figma CEO), Jeff Weiner (former LinkedIn CEO), Marc Benioff (Salesforce CEO), Sam Altman (OpenAI co-founder), and Elad Gil (early Airbnb investor). The company emphasizes transparency, privacy, and security, with features like zero data retention for enterprise users and control over AI autonomy.
